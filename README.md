# Carousel github Actions

These make it easy to automate all Carousel's software workflows, with their current CI/CD.

Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.

Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.

Carousel uses sonarcloud.io for their code quality, and to run automated tests.

_Carousel sees these actions as reusable and can be shared but use with caution._
